- [ ] Add a frequency field to the struct tree_node and update the frequency whenever a duplicate node is added to the tree
- [ ] Add the two output_dot graph printing functions which are found at /home/cshome/coursework/242/asgn-files/ on the COSC network
- [ ] Fix the rbt code so that the root of the tree is always black
